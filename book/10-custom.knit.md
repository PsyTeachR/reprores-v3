## Visualisation {#custom-viz}

### Set-up {#setup-custom-viz}

First, create a new project for the work we'll do in this chapter named <code class='path'>10-advanced</code>. Second, open and save a new R Markdown document named `visualisations.Rmd`, delete the welcome text and load the required packages for this section. You will probably need to install several new packages.

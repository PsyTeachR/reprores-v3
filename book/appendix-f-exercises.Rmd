# Exercises {#exercises}

You can access exercises and answers for all of the chapters through the `r pkg("reprores")` package.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# run this to access the exercise
reprores::exercise(1)

# run this to access the answers
reprores::exercise(1, answers = TRUE)
```

Alternatively, download all [exercises and data files](exercises/exercises.zip) below as a ZIP archive. The answers are not included in the zip file.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
exercises <- data.frame(
  n = 1:9,
  exercise = list.files("exercises", "\\d.*_exercise.Rmd", full.names = TRUE),
  answer = list.files("exercises", "\\d.*_answers.Rmd", full.names = TRUE),
  exercise_html = list.files("exercises", "\\d.*_exercise.html", full.names = TRUE),
  answer_html = list.files("exercises", "\\d.*_answers.html", full.names = TRUE),
  desc = c("Intro to R, functions, R markdown",
           "Create an R Markdown project",
           "Data visualisation",
           "Data",
           "Data relations",
           "Tidy Data",
           "Data wrangling",
           "Functions and iteration",
           "Simulation")
) |>
  mutate(entry = glue::glue("* Chapter {n}: {desc}\n      * Exercise: [Rmd]({exercise}) | [html]({exercise_html}); Answers: [Rmd]({answer}) | [html]({answer_html})"))


paste(exercises$entry, collapse = "\n") |> cat()

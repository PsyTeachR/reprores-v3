## Simulate Data

Here we will simulate data from a study with two conditions. 
The mean in condition A is 0 and the mean in condition B is 1.

```{r simulate}
n <- 100

data <- data.frame(
  id = 1:n,
  condition = c("A", "B") |> rep(each = n/2),
  dv = c(rnorm(n/2, 0), rnorm(n/2, 1))
)
```

## Plot Data

```{r condition-plot, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data, aes(condition, dv)) +
  geom_violin(trim = FALSE) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.25,
               aes(fill = condition),
               show.legend = FALSE)
```

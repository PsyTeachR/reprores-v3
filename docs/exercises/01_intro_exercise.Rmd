# please do not alter this code chunk

Edit the code chunks below and knit the document.


## Type commands into the console

In the console, type the following:

```
1 + 2
a <- 1
b <- 2
a + b
```

Look at the Environment tab in the upper right pane. Set the variable `how_many_objects` below to the number of objects listed in the environment.

```{r Q1}
how_many_objects <- NULL
```


## Understand function syntax

Use the `rnorm()` function to generate 10 random values from a normal distribution with a mean of 800 and a standard deviation of 20, and store the resulting vector in the object `random_vals`.

```{r Q2}
random_vals <- NULL
```


Use the help function to figure out what argument you need to set to ignore `NA` values when calculating the mean of `the_values`. Change the function below to store the mean of `the_values` in the variable `the_mean`.

```{r Q3}
the_values <- c(1,1,1,2,3,4,6,8,9,9, NA) # do not alter this line
the_mean   <- NULL
```


Figure out what the function `seq()` does. Use the function to set `tens` to the vector `c(0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ,60, 70 ,80 ,90, 100)`. Set `bins6` to the cutoffs if you wanted to divide the numbers 0 to 100 into 6 bins. For example, dividing 0 to 100 into 4 bins results in the cutoffs `c(0, 25, 50, 75, 100)`,

```{r Q4}
tens  <- NULL
bins6 <- NULL
```


Figure out how to use the `paste()` function to paste together strings with forward slashes ("/") instead of spaces. Use `paste()` to set `my_dir` to "my/project/directory".

```{r Q5}
my_dir <- NULL
```


## Install a package

Install the CRAN package called "cowsay". Run the code to do this and include it in the code chunk below, but comment it out. It is bad practice to write a script that installs a package without the user having the option to cancel. Also, some packages take a long time to load, so you won't want to install them every time you run a script.

```{r Q6}
# comment out the installation code

```


The code below has errors. Fix the code.

```{r Q7}
cowsay::say)
```

```{r Q8}
cowsay::say(by = pumpkin)
```


```{r Q9}
cowsay::say(by_colour = "blue")
```

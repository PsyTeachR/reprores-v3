The whole [psyTeachR](https://psyteachr.github.io) team at the University of Glasgow School of Psychology deserves enormous thanks for making it possible and rewarding to teach methods with a focus on reproducibility and open research. Particularly 
[Heather Cleland Woods](https://github.com/clelandwoods), 
[Phil McAleer](https://github.com/philmcaleer), 
[Helena Paterson](https://github.com/HelenaPaterson), 
[Emily Nordmann](https://github.com/emilynordmann),
[Carolina Keuper-Tetzel](https://github.com/carolinakt), and 
[Niamh Stack](https://github.com/eavanmac).

We greatly appreciate [Iris Holzleitner](https://github.com/orgs/facelab/people/iholzleitner)'s volunteer in-class assistance with the first year of this course. We were ever so lucky to get [Rebecca Lai](https://github.com/RebeccaJLai) as a teaching assistant in the second year; her kind and patient approach to teaching technical skills is an inspiration. [Benedict Jones](https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/jonesbenedictprofessor/) made invaluable contributions to the ethos of reproducible research at Glasgow. Thanks to [DaniÃ«l Lakens](https://github.com/Lakens) for many inspirational discussions and resources.

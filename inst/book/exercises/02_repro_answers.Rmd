My empirical research focuses on kinship and how social perception of morphology affects social behaviour. Specifically, I am interested in how humans use facial resemblance to tell who their kin are and how people respond to cues of kinship in different circumstances. I am also interested in the behavioural immune system and how pathogens influence mating and social behaviours.

My meta-science interests include teaching computational skills for reproducible research, large-scale collaboration, and developing web-based resources for increasing reproducibility in data collection and stimulus generation.

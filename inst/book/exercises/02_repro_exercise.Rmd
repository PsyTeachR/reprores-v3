Create a new project called "website".

In the "website" project, create a new Rmarkdown document called "index.Rmd". Do the following in this document:

* Edit the YAML header to output tables using kable and to use a custom theme.
* Write a short paragraph describing your research interests. 
* Include a bullet-point list of links to websites that are useful for your research. 
* Include a section with the level-2 header "Educational History" with a table of your educational history (e.g., with columns for years, degree, and institution). Hint: look at the help for ``tibble::tribble()` to set up a table in a code chunk.
* Add an image of anything relevant.
* Include a code chunk that displays a fortune from the fortunes package. 

* Knit this document to html.

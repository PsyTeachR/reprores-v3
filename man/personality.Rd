\description{
Archival data from the Face Research Lab of a 5-factor personality questionnaire. Each question is labelled with the domain (Op = openness, Co = conscientiousness, Ex = extroversion, Ag = agreeableness, and Ne = neuroticism) and the question number. Participants rate each statement on a Likert scale from 0 (Never) to 6 (Always). Questions with REV have already been reverse-coded (0 = Always, 6 = Never).
}
\details{
Instructions: A number of statements which people have used to describe themselves are given below. Read each statement and then click on of the seven options to indicate how frequently this statement applies to you. There are no right or wrong answers. Do not spend too much time on any one statement, but give the answer which seems to describe how you generally feel or behave.
